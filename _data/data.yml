    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a PhD Candidate at Rowan University. My research interests are in explainable AI and how these algorithms
      can affect the utility of a deployed model. My current work is on a now deployed machine learning model that is being used
      by clinicians in ICUs across the US. This model has been trained to predict all-cause mortality and gives an explanation of its prediction
      as well as an uncertainty metric in the form of a confidence score. More on this can be found in the projects section.
