    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a current PhD Candidate at Rowan University. My dissertation topic is how explainable AI affects the percieved 
      utility of a machine learning model when presented to experts in the field. Specifically, my model is trained to predict 
      mortality in the ICU given 12 lab values obtained during the patients first 24 hours at the hopsital. My research 
      interests are in influence functions, saliency maps, parameter pruning/compression, ensemble methods and feature selection.
